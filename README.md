#### React Assessment

### What is this app?
This app utilizes several librarys including jquery, react-bootstrap, react-dom, survey-react-ui, react-router-dom, and react-google-recaptcha. React manages all routes and pages built around the survey functionality of survey-react-ui.

An EmailJS account is linked to offer users the ability to email their assessment results to themselves. The EmailJS template is built using the EmailJS GUI along with several modifications to the resulting HTML.
